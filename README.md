# Deep Learning (in Julia)

This repo contains implementations and explanations of the concepts of Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville's *Deep Learning* textbook in the Julia language. I hope to go through Parts I & II in the next three months (the summer of 2024), perhaps touching on sections in Part III. I hope to implement models from scratch whenever possible, and may cover topics like FluxML and other parts of Julia's ML/DL ecosystem in later sections.

All code in this repo will be of the form of `Pluto.jl` notebooks. It would be great to eventually put these on my site as static HTML pages for easier accessibility.
